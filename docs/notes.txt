* Macros are different than functions and identify by ! after name.
    - can generate more complex code at compile time
    - provide additional functionality over regular functions.
    - println! macro allows for formatted strings and variadic arguments (a variable number of arguments).
* Formatting: println! is not just for printing plain text; it can also format strings. For example, println!("Hello, {}!", "world"); would replace {} with world.
* crates.io, the package registry for Rust. In Rust, we often refer to packages as “crates.”




GOOD SHIT
 Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.
