    - can generate more complex code at compile time
    - provide additional functionality over regular functions.
    - println! macro allows for formatted strings and variadic arguments (a variable number of arguments).
* Formatting: println! is not just for printing plain text; it can also format strings. For example, println!("Hello, {}!", "world"); would replace {} with world.
